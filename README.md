### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I believe that the Javascript was really fundamental in making the WebApp actually work. I learnt this under 5 hours and I was quite afraid that it would not end up well.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would renderthe complete info on each song in a playlist (Authour Name, Duration, Image etc.) on the featured page.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
